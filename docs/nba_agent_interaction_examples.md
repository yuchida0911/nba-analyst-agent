## 3. Advanced Interaction Modes

### 3.1 Multi-Turn Analysis Conversations

User: "I'm evaluating a potential trade: Damian Lillard for multiple young assets. Help me analyze this."

Agent: Interesting trade scenario! To provide the most accurate analysis, I need some details:

       📋 **Trade Details Needed:**
       • Which young assets are being considered?
       • Is this from Portland or Milwaukee's perspective?
       • What's the timeline for competing (win-now vs rebuild)?
       • Any salary cap considerations?
       
       I can start with Lillard's current value analysis while you provide details.

User: "Milwaukee perspective. They'd trade Lillard for Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett, and a 1st round pick from Toronto."

Agent: 🔍 Analyzing Milwaukee → Toronto trade scenario...
       📊 Evaluating immediate vs future value...
       🎯 Assessing fit and timeline implications...

TRADE ANALYSIS: LILLARD ↔ BARNES + BARRETT + 1ST
==============================================

**MILWAUKEE PERSPECTIVE:**

💰 **VALUE EXCHANGE:**
• Giving up: Superstar guard (age 34, 2 years left)
• Getting: Rising star + solid wing + future asset

📈 **IMMEDIATE IMPACT:**
• Scoring: -28.2 PPG (Lillard) vs +15.7 PPG (Barnes/Barrett)
• Playmaking: -7.3 APG vs +4.8 APG  
• Defense: Significant upgrade (younger, more versatile)
• **Net Impact: -12.5 PPG but +3.2 defensive rating**

⏰ **TIMELINE FIT:**
• Giannis window: 4-5 prime years remaining
• Barnes/Barrett: Entering prime (ages 23/27)
• **Verdict: Better long-term, risky short-term**

🎯 **CHAMPIONSHIP PROBABILITY:**
• With Lillard: 18% (next 2 years)
• With Barnes/Barrett: 12% (next 2 years), 22% (years 3-5)

**RECOMMENDATION:** 
⚠️ **CAUTION** - Milwaukee should demand additional compensation
Barnes alone doesn't replace Lillard's scoring. Consider requesting:
• 2 first-round picks instead of 1
• Or swap Barrett for a better 3rd player
• Or include promising young center (Poeltl?)

### 4.1 Data Limitations
```
User: "Analyze Kawhi Leonard's availability trends"

Agent: 🔍 Analyzing Kawhi Leonard's data...
       ⚠️ **Data Limitation Detected**
       
       Kawhi Leonard has played in only 23 of 58 games this season.
       
       **Available Analysis:**
       ✅ Per-game efficiency when healthy (limited sample)
       ✅ Game-by-game performance trends  
       ✅ Historical availability patterns
       ❌ Reliable season-long trends (insufficient data)
       ❌ Meaningful clutch analysis (only 8 clutch games)
       
       **Recommendations:**
       • Focus on per-game impact analysis
       • Compare to historical Kawhi seasons
       • Analyze load management effectiveness
