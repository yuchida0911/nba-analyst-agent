Core Advanced Basketball Metrics

This module implements advanced basketball analytics metrics including:
- True Shooting Percentage (TS%)
- Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)
- Usage Rate estimation
- Player Efficiency Rating (PER)

All metrics follow standard basketball analytics formulas and best practices.
